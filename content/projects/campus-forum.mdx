## Overview

Campus Forum is an experiment: can you build a modern-feeling communication platform with just Java Swing and an H2 embedded database? No Electron, no web stack, no heavy frameworks — just Swing pushed to its limits with a minimalist approach.

The result is a complete forum with real-time chat, AI features, voice input, and location sharing, all running as a lightweight desktop app.

## Minimalist Stack, Full Product

- **Java Swing** — custom-styled components to achieve a clean, modern UI far from Swing's default look
- **H2 embedded DB** — zero infrastructure, the entire database lives in the app
- **Selective API integrations** — GPT for grammar, IBM Watson for voice-to-text, DeepL for translation, Mapbox for location — each solving a specific problem without bloating the stack

## Features

- Posts, nested comments, boards, likes, and search
- Real-time chat with voice-to-text and AI conversation summaries
- Location sharing via Mapbox
- Multi-language translation
