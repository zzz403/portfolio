## Overview

KOKO is a voice-first communication platform designed for older adults. At its core is an AI agent that works across messaging apps — WeChat, WhatsApp, iMessage — so seniors can reach anyone without learning a new tool. I led the full-stack development as part of our startup course at UofT.

Currently being piloted and tested at multiple nursing homes across Ontario.

## Voice-First Interaction

Seniors don't type — they speak. KOKO's interface is fully tap-less: users hold a single button and say what they want. The AI agent interprets intent, routes messages to the right contact on the right platform, and reads replies back aloud.

## Cross-Platform AI Agent

The hardest problem KOKO solves is fragmentation. A senior's family might use WeChat, their neighbor uses WhatsApp, their doctor's office uses SMS. KOKO's agent sits in the middle — a unified conversational layer that sends and receives messages across all these channels on behalf of the user.

## Architecture

- **Voice pipeline** — WebRTC capture → speech-to-text → intent classification → action execution → text-to-speech response
- **Agent orchestration** — central message broker that maintains per-user conversation state across platforms
- **Platform adapters** — modular connectors for each messaging service (WeChat, WhatsApp, iMessage, SMS)
- **React frontend** — minimal, high-contrast UI optimized for accessibility and low vision
