## Why I Built This

UofT overhauled their library room booking system — and made it significantly harder to get a clear picture of what's actually available. The new interface buries availability behind multiple clicks, making it frustrating to quickly find a free study room across campus.

## Overview

Better Robarts Timetable aggregates real-time booking data from all UofT libraries and presents it in a single, easy-to-scan view. Despite the name, it covers every study room across all UofT library locations — over 200 rooms in total — not just Robarts.

## Key Features

- **200+ rooms, one view** — consolidates availability across all UofT library study rooms into a single interface
- **At-a-glance layout** — designed for quick scanning, so you can find a free slot in seconds rather than clicking through multiple pages
- **All libraries included** — covers Robarts, Gerstein, Engineering & Computer Science Library, and more
- **Real-time data** — pulls live booking information so availability is always up to date
