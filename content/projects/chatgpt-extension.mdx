## Overview

While using ChatGPT daily for learning and development, I kept running into the same friction points — no way to export conversations, math formulas impossible to copy, long threads becoming unreadable. Instead of waiting for OpenAI to fix them, I built an all-in-one extension that fills every gap I encountered. What started as a quick script grew into 9 feature modules, now refactored into a clean modular architecture.

## Features

- **Auto-hide old messages** — collapses older messages in long conversations, restores on scroll-up
- **LaTeX copy** — click any formula to copy raw `$$ LaTeX $$` syntax
- **Collapse/expand replies** — fold lengthy responses with one click
- **Screenshot capture** — render and capture conversation segments
- **Prompt replace** — trigger-word shortcuts that auto-expand into preset prompts
- **PDF export** — export full conversations as formatted PDF
- **Image copy** — render any message as an image and copy to clipboard
- **Floating ball** — conversation binding and quick-jump navigation
- **Multi-language** — i18n support for English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean

## Architecture

Modular content-script injection via Manifest v3 — 12 modules loaded in dependency order, each exporting through a `window.Booster*` namespace. MutationObserver watches for DOM changes to inject features as ChatGPT renders new content.
