## Overview

UniVoice is a research project in collaboration with the **Vector Institute** focused on building a unified speech foundation model purpose-built for real-time voice interaction. The core insight: pairing a lightweight, low-cost automatic speech recognition (ASR) system with a low-cost LLM correction layer can produce a system that is both cheaper and more accurate than existing high-cost monolithic solutions.

## The Core Idea

Current state-of-the-art voice systems face a tradeoff — high accuracy requires expensive models, while cheap models produce too many errors to be useful. UniVoice breaks this tradeoff by treating ASR and language understanding as complementary stages:

1. **Low-cost ASR** transcribes speech quickly and cheaply, even if imperfectly
2. **LLM correction layer** uses linguistic context to fix transcription errors in real time
3. The combined system achieves accuracy comparable to expensive end-to-end models at a fraction of the cost

## Research Directions

- **Multilingual** — unified model that handles multiple languages without separate per-language models
- **Multi-accent** — robust transcription across regional accents and non-native speakers
- **Multi-speaker** — accurate diarization and transcription in conversations with multiple participants
- **Real-time optimization** — latency-aware architecture designed for live voice interaction, not batch processing

## Status

Early-stage research project, started January 2026, in active collaboration with the Vector Institute.
