## Overview

2RaceWithMe is an interactive cycling system built for older adults at the AGE-WELL research lab. It runs on a dedicated device paired with Arduino sensors, making exercise more engaging and social.

## My Role

- **Compact speech recognition model** — trained and deployed a small ML model for recognizing a precise set of voice commands, enabling hands-free control during cycling sessions
- **Full-stack maintenance** — maintained the entire software stack, handling feature development, bug fixes, and deployment

## Key Features

- **Arduino sensor integration** for real-time cadence and resistance tracking
- **Dedicated device** with an immersive interface that responds to cycling input
- **Voice command recognition** via a lightweight on-device ML model tuned for a small vocabulary
- **Adaptive difficulty** that adjusts to individual fitness levels
