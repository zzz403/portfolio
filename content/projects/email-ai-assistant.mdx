## Overview

A personal productivity automation system that aggregates daily information, delivers it via email digest, syncs highlights to Notion, and generates a structured daily schedule — all without manual input.

## Key Features

- **Daily email digest** — automatically compiles and sends a summary of the day's key events, tasks, and updates each morning
- **Notion sync** — extracts important information and organizes it into structured Notion databases for long-term reference
- **Schedule generation** — drafts a prioritized daily timetable based on tasks, deadlines, and calendar events
- **Unified pipeline** — single automation run handles email → Notion → schedule in sequence

## Current Status

After Gemini's deep integration with Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Notion-like features), the core functionality of this project was largely replicated natively. The project is now in a rethinking phase — exploring what a custom-built system can offer that Gemini's ecosystem cannot, such as deeper personalization, cross-platform logic, or domain-specific intelligence.
