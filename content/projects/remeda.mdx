## Overview

Research project exploring how AI can transform clinical workflows — from intake to diagnosis to referral.

## Focus Areas

- **AI-augmented intake forms** that pre-screen patient symptoms before appointments
- **Automated summarization** of patient history and clinical notes
- **Intelligent charting support** to reduce documentation burden on physicians
- **Referral optimization** — matching patients to specialists with shorter wait times
