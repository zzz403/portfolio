## Overview

OpenBrowser AI is an AI-powered browser automation framework. Give it a natural language task, and it perceives, plans, and executes actions in a real browser — clicking, typing, navigating, and extracting data autonomously.

## Workflow Assets

The system transforms ephemeral agent explorations into permanent, reusable assets. First run records the full workflow; future runs replay it 10-100x faster with zero LLM calls. When websites change, it self-heals.

## Key Features

- **Perceive → Plan → Execute** loop with vision (screenshots + bounding boxes)
- **Dual asset generation** — UI workflows + direct HTTP crawlers
- **Self-healing** — AI-powered local repair when steps break
- **12+ LLM providers** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, Ollama, and more
- **MCP integration** — works inside Claude Desktop

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.12+ with LangGraph orchestration
- Chrome DevTools Protocol for browser control
- FastAPI + Next.js web UI with real-time streaming
