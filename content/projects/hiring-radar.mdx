## Overview

Hiring Radar is a personal job-hunting automation tool that continuously monitors company job boards, scores listings against your profile and preferences, and pushes real-time notifications across multiple channels — so you're always first in line to apply.

## Key Features

- **Multi-source scraping** — crawls job boards across different companies and platforms on a configurable schedule
- **Profile-based matching** — ranks listings by relevance based on your skills, experience level, location, and preferences
- **Real-time multi-channel alerts** — notifies you instantly via Discord, email, and other channels the moment a matching role is posted
- **Apply-first advantage** — designed to minimize the gap between a job going live and your application landing

## Current Status

This is an early-stage project — the core scraping and notification pipeline is functional. I'm actively looking for collaborators to help take it further. If you're interested in building this out together, [let's talk →](/#contact)
