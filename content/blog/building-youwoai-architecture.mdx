## Overview

When building YouWoAI, we faced a fundamental design question: how do you make an LLM system that's both accurate and reliable at scale?

Most architectures treat retrieval, orchestration, and evaluation as separate concerns. We took a different approach — co-designing them so each component informs the others.

## The Problem

Traditional RAG pipelines are linear: retrieve, then generate, then (maybe) evaluate. This creates blind spots. The retriever doesn't know what the generator struggles with. The evaluator catches errors too late.

## Our Approach

We built a feedback loop between all three layers. The evaluator's signals feed back into retrieval ranking. The orchestrator adapts its strategy based on real-time confidence scores.

The result: fewer hallucinations, better source attribution, and a system that genuinely improves with usage.
