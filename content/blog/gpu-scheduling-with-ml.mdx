## Motivation

Modern GPU workloads are increasingly heterogeneous. Traditional schedulers rely on hand-tuned heuristics that can't adapt to the diversity of today's workloads.

## Approach

We investigated using lightweight ML models to predict optimal scheduling decisions based on workload characteristics, historical performance data, and resource utilization patterns.

The key insight: even simple models can outperform static heuristics when given the right features to reason about.
